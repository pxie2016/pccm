# pfcm: Python-based Feature-specific Changepoint Modeling

## Introduction

This data science/machine learning personal project is based on
my [master's thesis](https://github.com/pxie2016/UWThesis) at
[University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu) 
[Department of Biostatistics](https://www.biostat.washington.edu),
which is in turn derived from work of Dr. Vito M. R. Muggeo 
from [University of Palermo](https://www.unipa.it). Specifically,
changepoint estimation methods from 
[Estimating regression models
with unknown break‚Äêpoints (2003)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.1545)
and [Segmented mixed models with random changepoints: A maximum
likelihood approach with application to treatment for depression
study (2014)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1471082X13504721)
are synthesized to estimate both fixed and feature-specific changepoints
using a custom simulated annealing algorithm inspired by 
[Wood (2001)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2676866).

The project was originally written by myself in R, a language commonly used in statistics
and data science communities worldwide. As a personal exercise at the intersection of statistics,
DS/ML, and full-stack web development, the development and deployment of this project is planned
in three large phases (that will be broken down into smaller phases):

1. The porting of the core algorithm from R to Python. üöß
2. Building RESTful APIs using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), 
and a front end using [Angular](https://angular.io/), with frequent and deliberate coordination.
3. Polishing the end product from 2. with elements in UI/UX design.
